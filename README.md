## Technologies Used 💻

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing restaurant, user, and food data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **bcryptjs**: Library to hash passwords and manage password encryption for secure authentication.
- **jwt (JSON Web Token)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Used for securely transmitting information between the client and server in the authentication process.
- **cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Request Sharing.
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies.
- **morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for node.js.
- **colors**: Library for adding color to console logs.

## Key Learnings 📚

- **API Development**: Learned to build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, enabling various functionalities such as authentication, data retrieval, and updates.
- **MongoDB**: Gained hands-on experience with MongoDB and Mongoose for managing data in a NoSQL environment.
- **Middleware Integration**: Mastered the use of various middlewares like `cors`, `cookie-parser`, and `morgan` for better request handling, security, and logging.
- **Routing**: Efficiently set up modular route handling to create clean and maintainable code.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error handling in the API, with the potential to extend it for more robust solutions.
- **Environment Management**: Worked with environment variables using the `dotenv` package to manage configuration settings securely.

## Key Features 🔑

- **User Authentication**: Includes routes for user login and registration with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
- **Restaurant Management**: Create, read, update, and delete restaurant data with proper authentication.
- **Category Management**: Allows the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of food categories, enabling efficient organization of the restaurant's menu.
- **Food Management**: Categorize and manage food items in the system.
- **User Management**: Admin can view and manage user profiles and data.
- **API Versioning**: The system is designed with versioning for backward compatibility as the API evolves.
- **CORS Support**: Allows the frontend to interact with the backend securely via Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## Additional Future Features 🚀

- **Payment Integration**: Add payment gateway integration to handle online orders and payments.
- **Table Reservation System**: Implement a feature for customers to reserve tables at restaurants.
- **Real-Time Order Tracking**: Enable real-time tracking of orders placed by customers.
